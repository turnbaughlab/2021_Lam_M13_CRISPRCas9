# 2021_Lam_M13_CRISPRCas9

The following code is provided for analyses performed in Lam et al., 2021. Phage-delivered CRISPR-Cas9 for strain-specific depletion and
genomic deletions in the gut microbiota

## Flow cytometry

Flow cytometry data were analyzed using R.

- [R Notebook](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?): Flow cytometry for in vitro: *E. coli sfgfp* vs *E. coli mcherry* with GFPT-M13 at 8h vs 24h
- [R Notebook](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?): Flow cytometry for mouse exp17: *E. coli sfgfp* vs *E. coli mcherry* with GFPT-M13
- [R Notebook](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?): Flow cytometry for mouse exp19: E. coli *sfgfp mcherry* with GFPT-M13


## 16S rRNA gene sequencing

Sequencing reads were processed in a QIIME2 pipeline as described and analyzed in R.

## Read alignment for genomic deletions

Sequencing reads were processed and aligned to reference genomes generated by Illumina/Nanopore hybrid assembly as described.

- [bash script](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?): Reads processing for in vitro: *E. coli sfgfp* after GFPT-M13 
- [bash script](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?): Reads processing for exp19: *E. coli sfgfp mcherry* after GFPT-M13
